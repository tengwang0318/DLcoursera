1. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?

   ### Answer: 

   False. Finding the characteristics of a model is key to have good performance. Although experience can help, it requires multiple iterations to build a good model.

2. It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

   ### Answer:

   False. It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
